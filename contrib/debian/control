Package: gridcoinresearchd
Architecture: any
Depends:${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Gridcoin (cli) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency using BOINC
 Gridcoin (cli) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that uses distributed computing 
 (BOINC) to benefit humanity by advancing the progress of medicine, biology, 
 climatology, mathematics, astrophysics, and more.
 .
 The aim of the Gridcoin project is to shift the computational power primarily 
 to BOINC projects whilst the POW mining calculations become a second priority 
 - so as the mining network scales up, the network's BOINC contribution is 
 scaled up in tandem.
 .
 This package provides the headless daemon, gridcoinresearchd.
